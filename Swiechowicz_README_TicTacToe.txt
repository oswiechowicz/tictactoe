FINAL PROJECT CS-UY 1114

STATE OF PROJECT:
The assignment has been completed in total, with some extra features. The initial progress for the project was slow as there were some errors encountered when initializing the empty board on the turtle canvas. A roadblock was hit during development in order to properly draw the X's on the board and draw the empty board itself. This was fixed when functions were defined independently to draw an X and an empty board respectively.

So far, the project has not been impossible to make but has challenged me to sharpen my skills using Turtle and also understanding lists to write a simple AI program. This was the most challenging part of the project because it forced me to think of an approach for the AI that could cover many situations. The AI was revised in several stages so that in the end it would be both effective and concise (or "dry").

Certain extra features were included to make the game more appealing. As planned, I color-coded the X's and O's in red and blue respectively. A last-minute change implemented was a dialog box each time a game over occurs that asks the human player if they wish to start a new game; along with this, a message is displayed on top of the playing grid to indicate whether the game over was due to a win, loss, or stalemate (in the color of the team that won). I am satisfied with my work so far, as my version replicates the one shown in the example video online.

ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS:
This assignment was interesting and an enjoyment to code because it is not overly complex or simple, but a good medium. The project has given me insight on how AI might be coded, and what troubleshooting strategies are used for longer projects or programs. I have made good progress in my project and was able to successfully finish it early thanks to being proactive with time management and receiving helpful feedback from my professor.
